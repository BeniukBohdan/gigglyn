## 🌍 Hey, I'm Gigglyn!

I'm a blockchain enthusiast driven by a passion for decentralization and distributed systems. I specialize in setting up and maintaining nodes and validators across various blockchain networks. Whether it's running full nodes, engaging in consensus mechanisms, or diving into the latest blockchain tech, I'm always ready to contribute to the community.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- **Node Operations**: I deploy and manage full nodes on different blockchain networks, ensuring they remain up-to-date and well-synchronized.
- **Validator Management**: I actively run validators, participate in staking, and work towards strengthening network security and decentralization.
- **Blockchain Exploration**: I'm continually exploring new protocols and technologies in the blockchain space, always eager to learn and apply the latest innovations.

### 🚀 What I'm Learning
I'm currently enhancing my skills in:
- Optimizing node performance
- Advanced consensus algorithms
- Governance models in decentralized networks
